Simulation and visualization of radio signals using Python and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
# Radio Signal Visualizer

## Overview
This project simulates radio signals and visualizes them using spectrograms.
Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is used for time–frequency analysis.

## Features
- Simulation of multi-frequency signals
- Addition of Gaussian noise
- STFT-based spectrogram visualization

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Motivation
Built to explore signal processing techniques relevant to physics
and data analysis applications.
